%% Experiment One  
% Measured resistance of a single resitor by comparing change in current in
% response to Voltage over time. Values stored in IoutExp1 and VinExp1

% Plot points as points and line of best fit.

%% Experiment Two :
% Measured voltage at the center of a standard voltage divider and studied 
% how it varied in response to change in voltage. 
% Values stored in VinExp2 and VinExp2.



%% Experiment Three :
% Measured current at the center of a standard voltage divider and studied 
% how it varied in response to change in current. 
% Values stored in IinExp2 and IinExp2.


% Experiment Four :
