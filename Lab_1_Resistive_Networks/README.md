# Lab 1 : Resistive Networks

This lab assignment focused on studying resistors and the error associated with them in various configurations, including in isolation, in voltage and current dividers, and in an R-2R ladder network.

The prelab and postlab assignments for this exercise required the derivation of various mathematical expressions used in the lab [report](https://anushadatar.github.io/olin-circuits-sp19/Lab_1_Resistive_Networks/docs/report/Lab1_Report.pdf).
