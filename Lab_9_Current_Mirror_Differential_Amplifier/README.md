# Lab 9 : Current Mirror Differential Amplifier
This lab assignment focused on studying the behavior of a differential amplifier made up of several differential pairs and current mirror circuits. 

The prelab and postlab assignments for this exercise required the derivation of various mathematical expressions used in the lab
