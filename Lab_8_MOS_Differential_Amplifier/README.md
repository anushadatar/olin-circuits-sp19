# Lab 8 : MOS Differential Amplifier
This lab assignment focused on studying the behavior of a very simple MOS differential amplifier made up of a differential pair and current mirror circuit. 

The prelab and postlab assignments for this exercise required the derivation of various mathematical expressions used in the lab
