# Olin College Circuits
Reports and Matlab code associated with Olin College ENGR2420 SP19: [Introduction to Microelectronic Circuits](http://madvlsi.olin.edu/circuits/).

Each individual directory corresponds to one of the lab assignments or projects associated with this course. Inside each directory, the /data_and_code folder contains MATLAB files, workspaces, and plots, and the /docs directory contains images and the report. Each directory also contains a short README with relevant links.

This repository was used to facilitate collaboration and documentation for Olin College students Abigail Fry, Anusha Datar, and Vienna Scheyer.

The lab experiments documented in this repository include: 
- [Lab 1 : Resistors and Resistive Networks](https://anushadatar.github.io/olin-circuits-sp19/Lab_1_Resistive_Networks/)
- [Lab 2 : Resistors and Diodes]((https://anushadatar.github.io/olin-circuits-sp19/Lab_2_Resistors_and_Diodes/)
