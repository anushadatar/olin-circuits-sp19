# Olin College Circuits
Reports and Matlab code associated with Olin College ENGR2420 SP19: [Introduction to Microelectronic Circuits](http://madvlsi.olin.edu/circuits/).

Each individual directory corresponds to one of the lab assignments or projects associated with this course. Inside each directory, the /data_and_code folder contains MATLAB files, workspaces, and plots, and the /docs directory contains images and the report. Each directory also contains a short README with relevant links.

This repository was used to facilitate collaboration and documentation for Olin College students Abigail Fry, Anusha Datar, and Vienna Scheyer.
