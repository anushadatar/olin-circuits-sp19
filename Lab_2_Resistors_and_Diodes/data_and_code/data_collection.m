% Experiment One : Diode-Connected 
    % Iin_Exp1_1 and Vout_Exp1_1 are from the first V-I characteristic
    % Vin_Exp1_2 and Iout_Exp1_2 are from the first I-V characteristic
% Experiment Two: Resistor in series w/ Transistor
    % Channel 2 sources voltage and measuring currents
    % Channel 1 is measuring voltage
    % Variable names are based off of resistor values
